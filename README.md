# 🚗 TripleTen Car Sales Dashboard - “Streamlit web app for data visualization using Python and Render”

This project is part of the **TripleTen Data Science Program**, built to demonstrate skills in data analysis, visualization, and web app deployment.

The goal of this project is to **analyze car sales data** and build an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore patterns such as price distribution, mileage, and other key features.
